# AS4 to AS6 Conversion Tool

A web-based tool for migrating B&R Automation Studio 4 (AS4) projects to Automation Studio 6 (AS6). It analyzes project files, identifies deprecated libraries and functions, and suggests replacements compatible with AS6.

## Features

- **Structure Analysis** – Parses folder structures to understand AS4 project layouts
- **Deprecation Scanning** – Identifies obsolete libraries (e.g., `MpCom`, `MpWebXs`) and suggests AS6 alternatives
- **Code Conversion** – Automatically updates syntax for renamed functions or types
- **Report Generation** – Exports a summary of changes and remaining issues

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended) or any web browser
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** 
    
    Example:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BRDK-GitHub/AS4_to_AS6_ConversionTool.git C:\projects\AS4_to_AS6_ConversionTool
   ```

2. **Download the AS6 Library Pack**

   The replacement AS6 library pack is required for the tool to suggest correct library replacements.

   📦 **Download here:** [AS6 Library Pack (SharePoint)](https://abb-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/p/mads-ravn_pedersen_dk/IQD6GnOHao4pQYgsskb2J0ozAZQ3WCFLRfN-QG6DeJNaiME?e=Q6BnRd)

   Alternative download path for AS6 Library Pack, if you are not an ABB employee: http://gofile.me/3rwUd/dYJOlPurL 

4. **Extract the libraries**

   Unzip the downloaded file and place the contents in the `LibrariesForAS6/` folder so that the structure looks like:

   ```
   AS4_to_AS6_ConversionTool/
   ├── LibrariesForAS6/
   │   ├── Library_2/
   │   └── TechnologyPackages/
   ├── as4-to-as6-converter.html
   ├── as4-converter.js
   └── ...
   ```

---

## Running the Tool

### Option 1: VS Code (Recommended)

1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Press **F5** or go to **Run → Start Debugging**
3. The web server will start and Chrome will automatically open to the converter page

Alternatively:
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+D** to open the Run and Debug panel
- Select **"Start AS4 to AS6 Converter"** from the dropdown
- Click the green play button ▶️

### Option 2: Command Palette

1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** to open the Command Palette
2. Type `Debug: Select and Start Debugging`
3. Select **"Start AS4 to AS6 Converter"**

### Option 3: Manual (Terminal)

1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run the Python HTTP server:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:

   [http://localhost:8000/as4-to-as6-converter.html](http://localhost:8000/as4-to-as6-converter.html)

## Usage

The application is divided into four main tabs:

### Tab 1: Project Selection
This is the starting point for your conversion process.

- **Upload Area** – Drag & drop your AS4 project folder or use the **"Select Project Folder"** button
- **Project Summary** – Displays a count of ST files, Packages, Libraries, and Hardware configurations found
- **Action** – Click **"Scan for Deprecations"** to proceed to analysis

### Tab 2: Analysis Results
Displays the findings from the deprecation scan.

- **Deprecated Libraries** – Lists libraries that need to be replaced (e.g., `MpCom`, `MpWebXs`)
- **Function Calls** – Shows specific code lines that require modification (e.g., `OpcUA` → `OpcUaCs`)
- **Issues** – Highlights potential problems like version mismatches

### Tab 3: Preview Changes
Allows you to review the modifications before applying them.

- **Diff View** – Shows "Before" and "After" views of your code files
- **Apply** – Buttons to confirm individual file conversions

### Tab 4: Report
Generates a final summary of the migration.

- **Export** – Save the migration log for documentation purposes

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"File not found"** | Ensure you selected the root folder of your AS4 project |
| **Server not responding** | Check that Python is running in the terminal (PowerShell window should still be open) |
| **Browser doesn't open** | Manually navigate to `http://localhost:8000/as4-to-as6-converter.html` |
| **Port 8000 in use** | Change the port: `python -m http.server 8080` and update the URL accordingly |
| **Version errors** (e.g., `MpServer 6.5.0 not valid`) | Verify `as6-libraries-index.json` is correctly configured for version `6.2.0` |
| **Chrome not opening** | Ensure Google Chrome is installed and set as default, or open the URL manually in Chrome |
